This book is truly unique in how it tackles the impactful and famous, but (for non-mathematicians at least) extremely difficult paper 'On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem' by Alan Turing. It not only explains the paper line by line, but also gives valuable background information and explains the importance and implications of the paper.

Through my computer science studies I was already familiar with turing machines, transfinite numbers, the lambda calculus and some other relevant topics. But this book covered them in more depth than what I had learned, and did a really good job in not only explaining the concepts, but also their backgrounds and relevance.

Still, the covered topics are hard and no author can change that. Despite my previous knowledge and Charles' clear explanations, some chapters went straight over my head. Particularly the chapter on Turing's ultimate proof that the Entscheidungsproblem cannot be solved and the chapter about Computable Functions was a bit too much for me.

But I guess I could have followed most of the topics I didn't get if I had devoted more time. I often read before bed or during a free hour during the day, which was not enough for me to understand every page. To me it was important that I grasp all the concepts, so I didn't bother to re-read 10+ page proofs I didn't get the first time. To each his own, I guess, although Charles even mentions a few chapters that can safely be skipped if it's not in your interest.

In the end I really learned a lot and added more depth to my understanding. Maybe I'll pick this book up again in the future and work it through in more detail. 

Overall I recommend this book to anyone who wants to _really_ know what Turing's famous paper is about, already has at least some pre-existing knowledge and is ready to devote time and work into it.

I don't think there is anything that comes close to what this book is doing, so whether you should read this book or not really depends on whether you are interested in the details of the paper or not.
