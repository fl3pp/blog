I've read this book after finishing [The World Atlas of Coffee](/the-world-atlas-of-coffee) from the same author, and found it to be exactly what I was looking for: An in depth guide, no-nonsense of how you can make very good coffee at home.

The book covers the art of brewing coffee from a theoretical perspective, including universal theory such as the impact of roasting and grinding, and many different techniques such as the french press, moka pot, V60 filter and of course, a closer look at espresso.

While doing so, it keeps a steady eye on topics such as quality, sustainability, cost-effectiveness and suitability for everyday preparation.

If you're a very entry-level barista and are interested in leveling up your coffee game without spending a huge amount of money and time, this book is exactly what you're looking for.
