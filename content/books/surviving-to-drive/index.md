I was very positively surprised by this book.

It is written in a diary fashion, and Günther more or less just wrote what was going on in his mind on that day, mixed in with some stories from his older days. It doesn't feel like the publisher redacted too much of the texts. Surely not the cursing!

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how a season in F1 feels like to a principle, or is interested in some stories Günther has to tell. I hope this book starts a trend and more people involved in F1 take on similar projects.
