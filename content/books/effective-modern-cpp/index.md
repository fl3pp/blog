I've read this book as supplementary material to an advanced C++ course I'm taking, and I've very much liked it.

The book takes a close look the most important changes from C++ 98 to C++ 11 / 14. Some include:

- move semantics
- type deduction
- auto deduction
- the new smart-pointers
- lambdas
- etc.

The writing style is very thorough but also pragmatic and pleasant. Given the depth of the content, there aren't many examples, but it felt like there were just enough to follow along. Maybe the course I've taken beside this book was just very good, but there wasn't a point where I couldn't follow along at all. 

The only critique I have is that sometimes I would have liked it if the book didn't go as deep, but got onto the next topic quicker to keep me entertained. Although given that the book wants to cover the (at the time) novel features with enough detail to get you up and running, this may not be an entirely fair point. C++ is not an easy language after all.

As of Summer 2023, only very few things aren't up date anymore. The book held up quite well, and most of the content is still very much relevant for C++ 20/23.

Surprisingly, there isn't much comparable material out there, at least not as a nicely currated collection in book-form. I am happy to have read this book and will take it out again if I'm looking for a quick refresher.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for way to get into the details of some specific Modern C++ areas.
