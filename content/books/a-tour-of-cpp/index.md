I very much enjoyed reading this book. As the creator of C++, Bjarne knows what he's talking about, and it's cool to read about some of his opinions and takes on the language.

While this book alone won't have a big impact on its own, I definitely rate it 5/5. It's a short but comprehensive tour of all the important C++ features without going too deep into the details.

What sets this book apart is its focus on how to program C++ the _right way_ - something that many struggle to do. The section at the end helps to put the language into the right perspective.

"A Tour of C++" is not a book for newcomers. Even developers coming from other languages might find it a bit tricky to follow at times. But for those who already have some C++ skills and are looking to understand what "Modern C++" is about, this book is an excellent read.
