Very similar to 'What If?' and 'How to'.

The only critique I can give is that, compared to the other books, this time Randall maybe focused a little more on 'extreme physical situations', as opposed to more realistic scenarios. But maybe that is just my feeling and not actually true.

Still, if you're new to the series, I would suggest starting with 'What If?' first before jumping into this one.

Overall it was nevertheless a very enjoyable read. Randall truly has a gift for explaining complicated topics and theories to mere mortals.

I recommend this book as an entertaining vacation read!
