I've heard good things about Rust and wanted to know what it is about. This book seemed like _the_ Rust Book since it is available for free online and many people contributed to it through its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/book). I started reading online and switched to the paperback once I was convinced it is worth a read.

After reading it back to back (except the last chapter), I think I have a good understanding of what Rust offers. The book feels a bit like a reference, working through the features of Rust, but there are also chapters where small programs are written and explained step by step. Still, overall I feel like the author wanted to cover as much as possible, leaving many small aspects explained but without examples.

This makes it difficult to judge the book: Does it want to be a language reference or an introduction? Probably a bit of both, with a tendency to the former:

- If you're looking for a book to get started with Rust right away, I would suggest reading the first few chapters only and then gradually read on while you're practicing.
- If you're looking for a reference, this book is probably sufficient (although I can't tell how much _hasn't_ been covered).

In comparison to the well-known K&R book, this book features fewer examples _and_ details. Given that Rust is a much more complex language than C, I think it wouldn't have been possible to go as far into the details (e.g. I didn't find an operator precedence table) and provide as many examples. Otherwise, it would have been a massive book. But it does feel like they took some inspiration from K&R.

For me, the writing style was very understandable and that is also the book's biggest strength. It really, really tries to get the reader to a point where he understands the concepts and doesn't slip into a snooty jargon-heavy style of writing as seen in other "language books". Only a very basic understanding of programming is required to get started, so it is beginner-friendly.

Of course, these are just my opinions. If you're unsure whether to start the book or not, just give it a try in the free online version.
