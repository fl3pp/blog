I've been unit-testing all my code for many years, but I lately felt like my test setup was missing something. The tests didn't support me in refactoring, and I was spending a considerable amount of time settings up the test environment to test a simple and short class.

In the search for possible explanations of these feelings, I've stumbled across the difference between the _London_ and _Detroit_ unit testing styles. After reading up on them, I was sure that I've been quickly strictly adhering to the London style, without realizing that other options existed. I've figured that reading up an old classic would kick-start my Detroit career, and I am very happy with the book-choice I've made, even if the book pre-dates the whole debate.

The book introduces you to Test-Driven Development in a gentle but direct fashion, and makes sure that you absolutely get the message. Two thirds of the book guide you through examples and keep the focus on practical matters. The last third of the book consists of a set of patterns and principles, which wrap up the loose ends you might still have and try to point you into a pit of success.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to take their unit testing game to the next level, no matter your level of experience. It is written in an approachable and easily digestible fashion.
