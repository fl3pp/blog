I'm generally not very interested in health books, but I am very glad that I've picked up this one.

Matthew takes the reader through the current state of sleep research, and focuses on a different area in each chapter. He doesn't shy away from a bit of theory, but always make sure to explain it thoroughly with relevant examples and impactful studies. He also lets the reader know when he leaves the proven path of science and enters speculation, but only goes far enough to fill in some important gaps.

Although I don't feel like this book was written as a self-help book, it contains many learnings that can be applied to your everyday life. But instead of just making suggestions for possible improvements, the author explains the mechanisms of sleep, how they are important to your health, and only then suggests ways to make use of them effectively. This makes the advice more impactful, at least for me.

I have made many changes to my sleep habits based on this book, and am happier for it. I thus recommend it to anyone who is interested in sleep or improving their sleep habits, particularly to those that appreciate a certain understanding on a subject before making changes.
