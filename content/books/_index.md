# Book Reviews

During the last few years, I've written small reviews of the books I've read over on Goodreads. At some point, I came across Scott Hanselmans post about how [your words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted) and decided to self-host the reviews here on my own blog, under my own domain. So, I've copied my reviews from Goodreads to this site, or at least the ones I've written something about (I didn't copy star-only reviews).

Regard these reviews as small comments that could just as well have been posted on Goodreads.
