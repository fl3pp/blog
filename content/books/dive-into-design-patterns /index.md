I've used this book in combination with the website refactoring.guru. Like the website, this book does a great job explaining the GoF patterns in very simple and understandable terms, adding multiple examples and explanations to the relationships between the patterns.

I'm not sure there is much more to learn in the book than on the website. There are a few chapters, such as 'Introduction to OOP' or 'Software Design Principles,' that I only found in the book, but for these topics, I would suggest a specialized book that goes into more depth, such as Clean Code.

Also, note that all patterns (excluding principles) originate from the original GoF book. Many more software patterns are just as important, but the GoF ones are probably the most important, and you do need to start somewhere.

This book (or the website) is excellent for people who get into programming or experts who occasionally need a little refresher. Or students that need to learn every GoF pattern in detail, such as me :)
