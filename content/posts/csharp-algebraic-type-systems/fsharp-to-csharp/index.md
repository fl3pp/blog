Although functional programming still doesn't seem to move the masses (at least not in my circles), some features traditionally found in functional programming languages begin to make their way into mainstream languages. One of these features are _algebraic type systems_.

In this post, we'll explore what algebraic type system are in (hopefully) simple terms, why they are useful, and how we can leverage F# to work with them in C#.
